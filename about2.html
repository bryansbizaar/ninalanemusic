          Nina Lane grew up on the Coromandel Peninsula in New Zealand
          surrounded by musicians, artists and writers. She began singing
          lessons with a classical coach at the age of 13yrs and found her
          passion in life. Nina went on to study other singing approaches with
          professional tutors over a period of 15 years. Concluding years of
          dedicated home practise, Nina built a singing voice she could trust
          and her own authentic singing voice emerged. It has been described by
          critics as “a unique voice, a rare instrument with a deep glowing alto
          tone like liquid honey ” (NZ Musicians Magazine).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As a singer-guitarist songwriter, Nina began promoting and touring her
          original music in her homeland in her early twenties. With Paul Ubana
          Jones as her mentor she performed as a national touring soloist for 14
          years and eventually took her music to Australia, Singapore, Asia,
          Northern Europe and America.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In order to successfully teach singing and songwriting at festivals on
          tour, Nina studied the ‘foundation of adult teaching’ at the Nelson
          Polytechnic. She worked as a coordinator and music teacher for
          troubled teens in Takaka supporting the musical interests of young
          musicians through to public performance. These students performed to
          full houses in the Takaka Village Theatre.
        </p>
        <br />

          In 1999, Lane teamed up and toured nationally as a duo with her long
          time and current music partner, Bryan Owens. Together they co-produced
          her self-titled debut album which included bass virtuoso James
          Wilkinson.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Seeking more musical opportunity and inspiration, the duo moved to
          America in 2001. ‘Sprygg’ an ethnic folk quartet, was formed in
          Portland, Oregon in 2015 and Nina’s repertoire expanded to include
          songs sung in Macedonian, Hebrew and more. Gradually alternate rhythms
          and melodies typically heard in these genres of music began to
          influence her songwriting. In Portland, she attended the Artichoke
          Music School and spent 6 years furthering her studies in the art of
          songwriting with tutor Matt Meghan.
        </p>
        <br />

          Lane has recently returned to New Zealand concluding a 20 year stint
          overseas. In Northland, she continues to teach singing and songwriting
          one-on-one to teenagers and adults and facilitate local creative
          songwriting groups. Her interest in combining original songs with the
          intricacies of ethnic folk music is reflected in her well-crafted
          stage performance today.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Nina has a new album out comprised of a fresh compilation of original
          songs. Michael Manring, Eric Thorin, Enion Pelta, Robin Jackson, Mark
          Powers, Bryan Owens and other refined instrumentalists feature on this
          record and compliment these rich thought provoking songs.
