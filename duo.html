            Contemporary singer-songwriter-guitarist Nina Lane (NZ) and
            multi-instrumentalist Bryan Owens (USA) write and perform an
            acoustic fusion of genres ~ alt-folk, blues and jazz reimagined.
            Nina is an original Kiwi songstress in an age of sound-alikes, with
            lyrics that resonate and imagery that lingers. She writes about
            places and people from her lengthy travels, the shifting sands of
            love and the magnetic pull of her birthplace Aotearoa, always
            calling her back home.

            "What stops people in their tracks is her unique voice, a rare
            instrument with deep glowing tones like liquid honey,"

            Originally from America, Bryan is an imaginative,
            multi-instrumentalist and master of soundscapes. As an accompanist
            he adds layers of colour and texture to the music on a variety of
            instruments, including mandolin, bouzouki, guitar, fiddle and
            well-blended vocal harmonies.

            Nina Lane and Bryan Owens have been performing, touring, writing and
            recording music together since their paths crossed two decades ago
            in the South Island of New Zealand. Their musical collaboration
            began in &apos;98 with Bryan arriving in NZ from Ireland with an
            Irish fiddler. The duo teamed up and began songwriting & national
            touring, co-producing Nina&apos;s debut album which promptly sold
            out. Two years later the duo left NZ shores for Portland, OR, USA in
            search of more musical inspiration & a world-folk quartet formed
            called Sprygg. The couple co-founded a Steiner program called
            &apos;Song Garden School&apos; and taught weekly children&apos;s
            music programs for 11 years.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Concluding a 20-year stint in the USA, the duo have returned to New
            Zealand and now call Northland their home. Nina teaches singing
            one-on-one with adults & children and facilitates a creative
            songwriting group in Whangarei. Bryan is a private music educator and teaches with Whangarei Youth Music. He
            facilitates a bi-weekly Traditional Folk Music class for adults and
            hosts a live folk music session around the table at &apos;The Jovial
            Judge Tavern&apos;.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The duo will be performing their latest album of original songs,
            &apos;Holding the Flame&apos; in the North Island this summer (now
            available on Bandcamp).
