        Nina Lane and Bryan Owens have been performing, touring, writing and
        recording music together since their paths crossed two decades ago in
        the South Island of New Zealand.The duo play contemporary original songs
        inspired by a fusion of musical genres - an alt-folk bluesy, jazzy,
        crossover. They accompany themselves on a range of instruments like the
        bouzouki, mandolin, fiddle and guitar and include well-blended vocal
        harmonies.

        Singer-songwriter guitarist Nina Lane is the lyricist who writes about
        intriguing people and places from her travels, the shifting sands of
        love and the magnetic pull of her birthplace Aotearoa, always calling
        her back home. “Her work reflects her love of the natural environment
        without becoming saccharine” Hauraki Herald. “A musician of dedicated
        quality and intellect” Paul Ubana Jones. “What stops people in their
        tracks is her unique voice, a rare instrument with deep glowing tones
        like liquid honey” Jo Hardy. Nina currently teaches singing one-on-one
        to children and adults and facilitates ongoing songwriting workshops in
        the Whangarei district.

        Bryan Owens is an imaginative, multi-instrumentalist and master of
        soundscapes. As an accompanist he adds layers of colour and texture to
        the music on a variety of instruments, including mandolin, bouzouki,
        guitar, fiddle and vocal harmonies. Bryan has recorded and performed
        with a wide range of musical ensembles from rock bands to
        singer-songwriters in NZ & America. He transcribed and published a
        tune-book called ‘Bryan’s Bizaar’ - a collection of tunes from near and
        far. Currently Bryan gives music lessons at Onerahi Primary school in
        Northland. He also teaches guitar and ukulele classes to adults with CEW
        ‘Community Education Whangarei’ and facilitates a weekly group class for

        The duo recently returned after a 20 year stint in the Pacific
        Northwest, USA. They have co-produced a new album of original songs
        called ‘Holding the Flame’ and their public performances include
        well-refined songs from the new album combined with original lively folk
        melodies (now available on Bandcamp).
