            Nina Lane grew up on the Coromandel Peninsula in New Zealand
            surrounded by musicians, artists and writers. She began singing
            lessons with a classical coach at the age of 13yrs and found her
            passion in life. Nina went on to study other singing approaches with
            professional tutors over a period of 15 years. Concluding years of
            dedicated home practise, Nina built an instrument she could trust and
            her own authentic singing voice emerged. It has been described by
            critics as "a unique voice, a rare instrument with a deep glowing alto
            tone like liquid honey" (NZ Musicians Magazine).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As a singer / guitarist / songwriter, Nina began promoting and touring
            her original music in her homeland in her early twenties. With Paul
            Ubana Jones as her mentor she performed as a national touring soloist
            for 14 years and eventually took her music to Australia, Singapore,
            Asia, Northern Europe and America.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In order to successfully teach singing and songwriting at festivals on
            tour, Nina studied the 'foundation of adult teaching' at the Nelson
            Polytechnic. She worked as a coordinator and music teacher for
            troubled teens in Takaka supporting the musical interests of young
            musicians through to public performance. These students performed to
            full houses in the Takaka Village Theatre.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In 1999, Lane teamed up and toured nationally as a duo with her long
            time and current music partner, Bryan Owens. Together they co-produced
            her self-titled debut album which included bass virtuoso James
            Wilkinson.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Seeking more musical opportunity and inspiration, the duo moved to
            America in 2001. 'Sprygg' an ethnic folk quartet, was formed in
            Portland, Oregon in 2015 and Nina's repertoire expanded to include
            songs sung in Macedonian, Hebrew and more. Gradually alternate rhythms
            and melodies typically heard in these genres of music began to
            influence her songwriting. In Portland, she attended the Artichoke
            Music School and spent 6 years furthering her studies in the art of
            songwriting with tutor Matt Meghan.
          </p>

            Lane has recently returned to New Zealand concluding a 20 year stint
            overseas. In Northland, she continues to teach singing and songwriting
            one-on-one to teenagers and adults and facilitate local creative
            songwriting groups. Her interest in combining original songs with the
            intricacies of ethnic folk music is reflected in her well-crafted
            stage performance today.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Nina has a new album out comprised of a fresh compilation of original
            songs. Michael Manring, Eric Thorin, Enion Pelta, Robin Jackson, Mark
            Powers, Bryan Owens and other refined instrumentalists feature on this
            record and compliment these rich, thought provoking songs.
