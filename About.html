    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>
      Nina Lane grew up on the Coromandel Peninsula in New Zealand, surrounded
      by musicians, artists and writers. She began singing lessons with a
      classical coach at the age of 13yrs and found her passion in life. Nina
      went on to study other singing approaches with professional tutors over a
      period of 15 years. Concluding years of dedicated home practise, Nina
      built a singing voice she could trust and her own authentic singing voice
      emerged. It has been described by critics as “a unique voice, a rare
      instrument with a deep glowing alto tone like liquid honey ” (NZ Musicians
      Magazine).
    </p>
    <p>
      As a singer-guitarist songwriter, Nina began promoting and touring her
      original music in her homeland in her early twenties. With Paul Ubana
      Jones as her mentor she performed as a national touring soloist for 14
      years and eventually took her music to Australia, Singapore, Asia,
      Northern Europe and America.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to successfully teach singing and songwriting at festivals on
      tour, Nina studied the ‘foundation of adult teaching’ at the Nelson
      Polytechnic. She worked as a coordinator and music teacher for troubled
      teens in Takaka supporting the musical interests of young musicians
      through to public performance. These students performed to full houses in
      the Takaka Village Theatre.

      In 1999 Lane teamed up and toured nationally as a duo with her long time
      and current music partner, Bryan Owens. Together they co-produced her
      debut album, Nina Lane. Seeking more musical opportunity and inspiration
      the duo moved to America in 2000. ‘Sprygg’ an ethnic folk quartet, was
      formed in Portland, Oregon in 2015 and Nina’s repertoire expanded to
      include songs sung in Macedonian, Hebrew and more. The alternate rhythms
      and melodies typically heard in these genres of music, then began to
      influence her songwriting. In Portland she attended the Artichoke Music
      School and spent 6 years furthering her studies in the art of songwriting
      with tutor Matt Meghan.

      Lane has recently returned to New Zealand concluding a 20 year stint
      overseas. In Northland she continues to teach singing and songwriting
      one-on-one to teenagers and adults and facilitate local creative
      songwriting groups. Her interest in combining original songs with the
      intricacies of ethnic folk music, reflect in her well-crafted stage
      performance today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina has a new album out comprised of a fresh compilation of original
      songs. Michael Manring, Eric Thorin, Bryan Owens and other refined
      instrumentalists feature on this record and compliment these rich thought
      provoking songs.
