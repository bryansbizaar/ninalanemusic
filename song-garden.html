            Many young children have an innate love of music and movement. Song
            Garden Music Time is an interactive, playful program that celebrates
            the joy of music, movement, and song in a nurturing group setting
            for children aged approximately 2-8 years. Sessions feature a
            children's repertoire of classic and contemporary songs, accompanied
            live on acoustic guitar, mandolin, and fiddle.

            Nina Lane and Bryan Owens began their musical collaboration in 1998
            and bring decades of experience as professional musicians,
            songwriters, recording artists, and educators. After touring
            extensively throughout New Zealand, they relocated to Portland,
            Oregon, USA in 2001, where they worked in the music and education
            fields for over 20 years. In 2009, they co-founded a
            Steiner-inspired program, Song Garden School, and facilitated weekly
            children's music programs for 11 years.

            School, Swallowtail, Shining Star, and Song Garden School in the
